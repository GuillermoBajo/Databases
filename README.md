# Databases

This repository contains three databases, each focused on a different domain: football leagues, cinematography, and aviation. Each database includes entity models, relationships, and constraints, as well as SQL queries and triggers to maintain data integrity and facilitate the management of information specific to each area.

## Designed Databases

- **Football League**: A database to organize information about football leagues, including entities such as divisions, seasons, matchdays, matches, teams, and stadiums.
- **Cinematography**: A database that records information about individuals, content (movies and series), and episodes, including their relationships and characteristics to manage people's involvement in content and the attributes of each type of work.
- **Aviation**: A database designed to manage information about airlines, airplanes, models, flights, airports, and incidents, including delays, diversions, and cancellations, along with their respective relationships.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For table creation, queries, and data manipulation.
- **E/R Models**: To design the conceptual structure of the database.
- **Normalization**: To ensure data integrity and efficiency.
- **Views and Triggers**: To optimize queries and maintain data integrity.
- **Database Population**: Using `.csv` files and population scripts.

## Key Features

- **Data Organization**: Into entities such as divisions, seasons, matches, teams, and stadiums.
- **Relationship Definition**: Between entities to maintain data consistency.
- **Constraints**: Such as primary and foreign keys to ensure referential integrity.
- **Complex Queries**: To extract detailed information about leagues, teams, and matches.

## System Design

- **E/R Design**: Defines the entities and their relationships in the database.
- **Normalization**: Ensures consistency and efficiency in the data structure.
- **Table Creation and Queries**: To implement the database and its operations.
- **Constraint Implementation**: To ensure data validity and integrity.
- **Data Management**: Through procedures for populating and manipulating the database.
